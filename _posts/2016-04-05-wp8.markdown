Trailer development (WP7)
=========================

At the day of writing, this work package has not really been active. Its
purpose, on the long term, is to have a working demonstration of our
tools, so we will be able to promote our software with a real example of
what can be achieved using it. In the coming months, we will need to
consider different scenarios and scenes we would be able to render. We
may have to contact some artists using Blender, but some of us know (at
least the basics) of Blender animation.
