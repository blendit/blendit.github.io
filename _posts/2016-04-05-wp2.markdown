title:  "Presentation of the Blender Code WP"
---

The goal of this work package was to explore the inner workings of
Blender and its scripting interface. We also presented the Python
language and the scripting interface of Blender to the whole group. In
addition to that, we also implemented unitary tests linked to Github,
as well as coverage tests.
