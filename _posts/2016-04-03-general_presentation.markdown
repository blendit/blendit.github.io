## General objective of this project

The goal of this project is to design two open-source plugins for
Blender, which is a computer graphics software.  One of these plugin
will be able to render and animate crowds, and the other one to design
environments by making different elements such as rivers and mountains
automatically interact to produce realistic scenes. Although this kind
of software is already developed in the Computer Graphics industry, it
is often unavailable to the public and not of free use.

### Blender

Blender is a free software of 3D animation. See [their website](blender.org).

### State of the art

Here is a brief state of the art, more informations will be provided on each work package page.

#### Crowds

We mainly based our work on an article called [PLEdestrians A Least-Effort Approach to Crowd Simulation](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/PLE/) (some images are on the website of the article).

#### Envs

We thought the ideas presented in ["A declarative approach to procedural modeling of virtual worlds", Smelik et al](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2011/STDB11a/STDB11a.pdf) were really interesting, and we tried to implement the same ideas into blender.
