## General objective of this project

The goal of this project is to design two open-source plugins for
Blender, which is a computer graphics software.  One of these plugin
will be able to render and animate crowds, and the other one to design
environments by making different elements such as rivers and mountains
automatically interact to produce realistic scenes. Although this kind
of software is already developed in the Computer Graphics industry, it
is often unavailable to the public and not of free use.
