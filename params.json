We will be working on the development of Python scripts and add-ons to Blender, to produce realistic crowd and swarm generators, as well as environment generators. \r\n\r\nBelow are some pictures taken from articles presenting techniques we would like to add to Blender:\r\n\r\n### Crowd generation\r\n\r\nReal crossing in Tokyo, Japan:\r\n\r\n![Real crossing in Tokyo, Japan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blendit/blendit.github.io/master/images/PLE-2.png)\r\n\r\nSimulated crowd  ![presented here](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/PLE/):\r\n\r\n![Simulated crowd presented in http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/PLE/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blendit/blendit.github.io/master/images/PLE-1.png)\r\n\r\n### Environment generation\r\n\r\nImage taken from ![\"A declarative approach to procedural modeling of virtual worlds\", Smelik et al.](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2011/STDB11a/STDB11a.pdf):\r\n\r\n![Image taken from \"A declarative approach to procedural modeling of virtual worlds\", Smelik et al.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blendit/blendit.github.io/master/images/env1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n- @coma94\r\n- @d1laj\r\n- @rmonat\r\n- @vlutfall\r\n- @joseif\r\n- @omariott\r\n- @PijusSimonaitis\r\n- @gullcomb\r\n- @bboisson\r\n\r\n## Work packages (in **bold**, the head of each Work Package)\r\n\r\n* Communication @coma94, @joseif, **@rmonat**\r\n* Blender Code **@coma94**, @PijusSimonaitis, @rmonat\r\n* Bibliography on crowds @d1laj, **@joseif**, @vlutfall\r\n* Bibliography on environments @bboisson, **@gullcomb**, @omariott\r\n* Crowds plugin development @d1laj, @coma94, **@joseif**, @PijusSimonaitis, @vlutfall\r\n* Environment plugin development @bboisson, @coma94, **@gullcomb**, @omariott, @rmonat \r\n* GUI development @coma94, @gullcomb, **@vlutfall**\r\n* Trailer @d1laj, **@coma94**, @joseif\r\n\r\n## Support and Contact\r\n\r\nPlease get in touch with @rmonat if you want more informations concerning this project.
